/**
 * LangChain `Embeddings` adapter that delegates to a Transformers.js
 * `feature-extraction` pipeline.
 *
 * Why this adapter exists: every retriever / vector store in LangChain
 * accepts the abstract `Embeddings` shape. Pointing them at our local
 * Transformers.js pipeline through this thin wrapper means BM25,
 * MemoryVectorStore, the ensemble retriever, and the LangGraph nodes
 * don't have to know our model came from on-device inference.
 *
 * Vectors are L2-normalised by Transformers.js (`normalize: true`) so
 * downstream cosine similarity collapses to a dot product.
 *
 * **Task-specific prompts.** EmbeddingGemma is trained for asymmetric
 * retrieval: passages get one prompt prefix, queries get another. The
 * prefixes are part of the training objective — feeding raw text into
 * both sides produces materially worse retrieval. We apply them here
 * so call sites stay unchanged (`embedDocuments` for chunks,
 * `embedQuery` for the user's question and for the relevance gate).
 * Swapping back to a symmetric embedder (e.g. bge-*) means deleting
 * the prefix calls — they're a no-op on those models but spend a few
 * tokens of context per pass.
