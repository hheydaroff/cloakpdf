/**
 * Crypto Web Worker — off-main-thread self-signed certificate generation.
 *
 * Generating a 2048-bit RSA key pair (forge.pki.rsa.generateKeyPair) is a
 * multi-second CPU burst that freezes the UI when run on the main thread. This
 * worker runs it off-thread and posts the result back as PEM strings, which the
 * main thread losslessly reconstructs into forge objects
 * (forge.pki.privateKeyFromPem / certificateFromPem) for PKCS#7 signing.
 *
 * It imports only the forge-based cert builder — never pdf-signer.ts (which
 * pulls in pdf-lib) — so the worker chunk stays lean and is fetched lazily, the
 * first time a user actually generates a certificate.
 *
 * The project's tsconfig uses `lib: ["ES2025", "DOM"]` (no WebWorker lib), so
 * `self` is typed as a Window. `onmessage` assignment is fine; `postMessage` is
 * narrowed through a small typed shim to avoid the Window overload that demands
 * a `targetOrigin`.
