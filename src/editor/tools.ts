// tools.ts — Rail metadata for the canvas editor's single-PDF tools.
//
// This is metadata only (id / label / icon / group / which view mode it drives
// / build status). The actual Tool behaviour (canvas interaction) and Panel
// (right-side options) are bound per id in the dispatchers, mirroring CloakIMG.
// The roster is the single-PDF tools that live in the editor (incl. redact +
// ocr) — see REDESIGN.md for the disposition of every CloakPDF tool. Multi-file /
// terminal / security-cert / AI tools are NOT here; they live outside the editor.
//
// Order is by real user priority / frequency of use — top of the rail is the
// tool a typical user reaches for most. Tools stay grouped into thematic
// families (the group label shows in the Properties panel and the rail draws a
// hairline between families); families and the tools inside them are then sorted
// by frequency. The everyday core leads — Annotate, Signature, Fill form,
// Organize, Redact — then privacy clean-up, transforms, repeating page
// "furniture" (stamps / numbering), and finally the rarely-touched extras.
