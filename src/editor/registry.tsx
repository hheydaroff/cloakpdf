// registry.tsx — Binds editor tool ids to their implementation: an optional
// Stage (canvas interaction, registers via useStageProps; focus tools only)
// and a Panel (right-side options). This is the id → {Stage, Panel} map the
// two dispatchers (EditorToolStage / ToolControls) read, mirroring CloakIMG's
// Tool/Panel split. Tools land here milestone by milestone; ids absent from the
// map render a placeholder panel and no canvas behaviour.
