# CloakPDF Canvas Redesign

> Working spec for the `feature/redesign` branch. Goal: turn CloakPDF from a grid of
> 34 isolated tools into a **canvas-centric, Photoshop-like PDF editor** — left tool
> rail, center PDF in full focus, right per-tool options panel — modeled on the sibling
> app **CloakIMG** (`/Users/sumit.sahoo/Developer/Personal/cloakimg`, `src/editor/`).
>
> This is a big-bang effort: all work lands on `feature/redesign` (branched from `dev`)
> and merges only when the whole experience is ready. No production feature flag.

> **Status (post-implementation cleanup).** The editor is built and is the primary
> surface; the home is editor-first (drop a PDF → editor). Since this spec was written,
> three things changed and any reference below is historical:
>
> - **Workflows was removed entirely** — the unified editor replaced the chained-tool
>   runner. There is no `src/workflow/`; `useToolOutput` is now just a download helper.
> - **The standalone tool layer was trimmed** — only 8 tools that can't be a single-PDF
>   "edit then export" flow remain as home cards (in `src/standalone/`, was `src/tools/`).
>   The other ~26 standalone components were deleted; their capability lives in the editor.
> - **Paths moved:** editor panels are `src/editor/panels/` (was `src/editor/tools/`),
>   and `src/utils/pdf-operations.ts` is now a barrel over cohesive `src/utils/pdf/*`
>   modules. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the current architecture.

## Locked decisions

1. **Editor-first immediately.** The home screen becomes a thin launcher. Dropping a
   single PDF goes straight into the canvas editor. The categorized tool grid is
   demoted to a secondary "all tools / multi-file" surface, not the default.
2. **Page view = focus + overview.**
   - **Focus mode** (default for editing): one page fills the canvas (zoom/pan, overlay
     drawing). A thumbnail strip navigates pages. Selecting a page makes it the focus.
   - **Overview mode** (toggle): a grid of all pages for browsing + page-board edits
     (reorder / rotate / delete / duplicate / extract / select). Click a page → drop
     into focus mode on it.
3. **Rollout = branch + big-bang merge.** Everything is built on `feature/redesign` off
   `dev`. Standalone tool components may stay during development for reference, but the
   release is a single merge once the editor is complete — no half-migrated production
   state, no runtime flag.

## Why this shape (analysis summary)

- **CloakIMG is a near-perfect chrome template.** Its editor is a pure-flexbox shell —
  `TopBar / ToolRail (left, 72px) / StageHost+ToolStage (center) / PropertiesPanel
(right, 328px)` — with a `layout` (mobile/tablet/desktop) switch and a morphing
  `MobileEditorSurface` bottom sheet (collapsed → picker → tool). State is a 3-way
  context split (stable **Actions** / volatile **ToolState** / **Read**) so slider drags
  never re-render the chrome. `StageHost`/`ToolStage` mount the canvas **once** and only
  swap the active tool's hook bindings — the anti-flash trick. All of this ports.
- **CloakPDF already has a working one-tool canvas.** [`src/tools/RedactPdf.tsx`](src/tools/RedactPdf.tsx)
  is functionally a single-tool editor: page `<img>` (PDF.js thumbnail) + absolutely
  positioned `<canvas>` overlay, `ResizeObserver` sizing, **fraction-rect** geometry
  (`{xPct,yPct,wPct,hPct}`), page nav, per-page undo. Generalize it → the center stage.
  [`src/tools/OrganizePages.tsx`](src/tools/OrganizePages.tsx) + `SortableGrid` +
  `useSortableDrag` → the overview page-board.
- **The tool classification already exists.** [`src/workflow/registry.ts`](src/workflow/registry.ts)
  lists exactly the 20 "single-PDF-in → single-PDF-out" tools — the natural rail tools.
  Its exclusions are precisely the tools that stay outside the editor.
- **Routing note:** despite CLAUDE.md's "useState + URL hash" claim, routing is **pure
  in-memory React state** ([`src/App.tsx`](src/App.tsx)) — no hash, no deep links, refresh
  returns home. Deep-linkable editor state is a Phase-3 decision (see Open questions).

## Core architecture: the document model

CloakIMG bakes raster pixels into history every commit. **Do not copy that** — a 50-page
PDF would blow memory (CloakIMG caps history at ~30 for a _single_ image). Model the doc
**non-destructively** and materialize bytes only on export.

```ts
// src/editor/doc.ts
interface CanvasDoc {
  id: string
  fileName: string
  bytes: Uint8Array            // canonical, pdf-lib-writable source of truth
  pageCount: number
  pages: PageMeta[]            // { index, widthPt, heightPt, rotation, thumbUrl|null }
  objects: CanvasObject[]      // non-destructive overlays, fraction-rect space
}

// discriminated union, reuses AnnotatePdf's Annotation + RedactPdf's RedactionRect shapes
interface CanvasObject {
  id: string
  kind: 'annotation' | 'signature' | 'stamp' | 'text' | 'watermark' | 'pageNumber' | ...
  pageIndex: number
  rect: { xPct: number; yPct: number; wPct: number; hPct: number }   // top-left, 0..1
  payload: unknown
}
```

**Everything is a `DocTransform`** — one code path for the canvas, the right-panel Apply
buttons, and the headless workflow runner:

```ts
type DocTransform = (doc: CanvasDoc) => Promise<{ bytes: Uint8Array; label: string }>;
// applyTransform(t) runs under a busy spinner → new bytes → re-render dims/thumbnails → commit
```

Three op classes (each wraps an existing `pdf-operations.ts` writer):

| Class                                | Tools                                                                                             | Behavior                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overlay-object** (non-destructive) | annotate, signature, stamp/watermark, page-numbers, header/footer, bates                          | Tagged objects painted on the overlay canvas; burned into bytes only at export        |
| **Destructive-drag**                 | redact                                                                                            | Draw boxes → on Apply, `redactPdf` rasterizes+burns (stays destructive per CLAUDE.md) |
| **Whole-doc byte op**                | compress, grayscale, flatten, repair, reverse, extract, remove-blank, n-up, metadata, scrub, crop | Options-only panel → byte transform on Apply, new bytes pushed as a history entry     |

**History** ([`src/editor/history.ts`](src/editor/history.ts)): linear op-list, cursor index,
cap ~40. Entries snapshot `{ bytes-by-ref | objects-diff, label }` — **never** rendered
rasters. Object-only edits keep `bytes` by reference; only true byte transforms snapshot new
bytes. `commit(label)` bumps a `docVersion`; undo/redo restore bytes+objects and re-render
only affected thumbnails.

  rail 72px          center flex-1 (min-w-0)                 panel 328px
```

- **Left rail** — icon buttons grouped by category, hairline `bg-slate-200/70` separators;
  active = single Ocean-Blue 2.5px left edge-bar (one cue, per DESIGN.md).
- **Center** — persistent `PdfStage` (never remounted on tool switch) + page-thumbnail
  strip + history scrubber. A `Focus | Overview` segmented toggle in the TopBar swaps the
  stage between single-page focus and the grid page-board.
- **Right** — `key={activeTool}` panel hosting the tool's existing options JSX + an
  Objects/layers list pinned at bottom (auto-hidden when empty).
- **Tablet** (760–1180px) narrows the panel via a `collapsed` prop — no third layout.

### Overview mode (the page-board)

Reuses `SortableGrid` + `useSortableDrag` + `PageThumbnail`. Multi-select pages; the right
panel shows page-board actions (rotate, delete, duplicate, extract to new PDF, insert
blank, splice another PDF). Click a page → focus mode on it. This is where
`organize-pages`, `reverse-pages`, `remove-blank-pages`, `extract-pages`, `contact-sheet`,
and `n-up` live as overview verbs rather than separate tools.

## Mobile layout (mirror `MobileEditorSurface` exactly)

Below 760px the rail + right panel disappear; the page spans full width. One **in-flow
morphing bottom surface**: collapsed (just a "Tools" glyph on the page) → picker (4-col
grid) → tool (the _same_ options component desktop uses) → sticky ✕/✓ footer. Sheet height
is `ResizeObserver`-measured, capped at 50% of the column so the page stays dominant;
because the sheet is in-flow (not fixed), the canvas reflows and the whole page stays
visible. Overview mode = full-screen page grid. Honor CloakIMG's documented gotchas: await
flush-pending-apply before tool switch, restore the transition string after drag, no
transform-animation on the picker's scroll children (kills iOS momentum scroll).

## State architecture (`src/editor/EditorContext.tsx`)

Port CloakIMG's sliced-context pattern, PDF-shaped:

- **`EditorActionsCtx`** — stable callbacks: `setActiveTool, patchToolState, applyTransform,
commit, undo/redo/jumpTo, reset, registerPendingApply/flushPendingApply,
cancelCurrentTool, addObject/updateObject/removeObject, setViewMode, deliverExport`.
  Never re-renders.
- **`ToolStateCtx`** — high-frequency per-slider-tick tool options.
- **`ActiveToolCtx`** — just `activeTool` (rail + dispatchers subscribe here).
- **`EditorReadCtx`** — doc identity, view (zoom/pan/selectedPage/viewMode), history flags,
  layout breakpoint.

**Per-tool state** is namespaced — `toolState: Record<ToolId, object>`, each tool owns a
slice with its own defaults (`patchToolState(toolId, partial)` merges). Slices persist
across tool switches; reset on doc-replace. (CloakIMG's single ~120-field flat struct is
rejected as a mismatch for PDF's per-page, per-tool diversity.)

## Center stage (`src/editor/PdfStage.tsx`)

Generalize `RedactPdf`'s surface, mounted **once** (CloakIMG `StageHost` anti-flash):

- `<div ref=containerRef relative>` holding `<img src={thumbnails[selectedPage]}
className="w-full h-auto pointer-events-none">` (PDF.js `renderPageThumbnail` at
  `PREVIEW_SCALE=max(1.5,dpr)`; strip thumbnails ~0.4) + absolutely-positioned
  `<canvas absolute inset-0 touch-none>` sized by `ResizeObserver`.
- A `useStageProps`-style context lets the active tool register
  `{ paintOverlay(ctx,cw,ch), onPointerDown/Move/Up(imgPoint), cursor }`, cleared on
  unmount so stale overlays never bleed.
- **All geometry** stays in top-left fraction-rect space (0..1) for storage + pointer math
  (`(clientX-rect.left)/rect.width` clamped via `getBoundingClientRect`), converted to PDF
  points only at transform time — exactly RedactPdf's model.
- Render via **PDF.js**, mutate via **pdf-lib** — the split is preserved. Pass
  `PDFJS_WASM_URL` to every `getDocument`; `slice(0)` the input buffer per consumer
  (PDF.js detaches it to its worker; pdf-lib needs the original bytes at Apply).

## Rail groups (reuse the 4 non-AI categories)

1. **Privacy & Security** — redact, pdf-scrub, metadata (redact front-loaded; brand-defining)
2. **Annotate & Sign** — annotate, signature, stamp/watermark, page-numbers, header/footer, bates, fill-form
3. **Pages** (overview verbs) — organize, extract, reverse, remove-blank, n-up
4. **Transform** — crop, compress, grayscale, flatten, repair, ocr
5. **Document** — bookmarks, attachments

## Milestones (all on `feature/redesign`)

**Status: M0–M3 DONE; M4 first cut (editor-first routing) landed — iterating before merge.**
Verified per milestone by `vp check` + 194 unit tests + build + real-browser
`tests/e2e/editor-smoke.ts` (16-step chain incl. export + autosave-restore) and
`tests/e2e/home-routing.ts` (editor-card preselect + constructor hand-off). The big-bang
merge to `dev` is **deliberately deferred** — the editor-first surface will be refined over
several iterations and merged only when ready. Commit trail (base dev `53be458`): M0–M2 per
the earlier log; revamp R1–R5 + design-review fixes `3e72c7f`; M3a autosave `fb7adf2`, M3b
export menu `b3b4bf5`, M3c constructors `8674acf`; M4 editor-first routing `f78ab52`.

- **M0 — Editor shell + doc core. ✅** `{kind:"editor"}` view; `src/editor/` (`breakpoints.ts`,
  `EditorContext.tsx` w/ 4 sliced contexts + `CanvasDoc` + op-list history, `PdfStage.tsx`
  - `useStageProps`, `EditorShell.tsx`, `MobileEditorSurface.tsx`, `tools.ts`). Load via
    `usePdfFile`+`renderAllThumbnails`; focus + overview modes; zoom/pan/page-nav; undo
    skeleton. Home → minimal launcher routing into the editor. **Exit:** drop a PDF, view /
    navigate / zoom / overview-grid, empty rail.
- **M1 — Reference tools. ✅** redact (destructive-drag) + annotate (overlay) + organize-pages
  (overview page-board) — proves persistent-stage → dispatcher → history → deliver on
  desktop + mobile.
- **M2 — Every single-PDF tool. ✅** Landed in tranches: M2a whole-doc options (compress,
  grayscale, flatten, repair, reverse, n-up); M2b metadata + scrub; M2c extract +
  remove-blank; M2d-i stamp-family (page-numbers, header/footer, bates, watermark); M2d-ii
  signature + crop (canvas-placement) + the CropBox geometry fix in `PageMeta`; M2e-i
  fill-form + bookmarks + attachments (panel-only); M2e-ii OCR searchable-text (desktop-only).
- **M3 — Polish + constructors. ✅** draft autosave (`src/editor/draft-store.ts`, IndexedDB
  keyed by SHA-256 of the original bytes, RAG-persistence idiom; restore banner on reload +
  "restore last session" card on the empty editor); Export menu (`ExportMenu.tsx` — PDF /
  pages-to-images zip / 3×3 contact-sheet / split-to-pages zip, via the new non-mutating
  `runTask`); multi-file constructors (merge / images-to-pdf) hand off into the editor
  (`OPEN_EDITOR_EVENT`). _(Known follow-up still open: `applyTransform` re-renders ALL page
  thumbnails on every apply — optimise to re-render only changed pages before large-doc QA.)_
- **M4 — Editor-first home + cutover. 🟡 first cut.** Editor-eligible tool cards now open the
  editor with that tool preselected (`EDITOR_TOOL_IDS` gate in `App.handleSelectTool`,
  `initialTool` through `EditorView`/`EditorProvider`); the existing categorised grid serves
  as the all-tools directory; breakpoint QA (mobile/tablet/desktop) clean. **Deferred for
  iteration:** a dedicated thin-launcher home; splitting the directory so the 20 editor tools
  drop off the grid (kept for now for search/discoverability); **retiring** the migrated
  standalone components (they're non-destructively kept — Workflows still render every tool by
  id through `toolComponents`, so deletion would break the workflow runner); and the
  **big-bang merge to `dev`** (held until the surface is ready, per direction).

## Top risks → mitigations

1. **History memory blowup** if we raster-snapshot like CloakIMG → op-list/objects-diff
   only, re-derive rasters from `pdf-renderer`. _(The single most important deviation.)_
2. **PDF.js detaches the input ArrayBuffer** → `slice(0)` per consumer (RedactPdf already does).
3. **Destructive ops degrade downstream** (redact loses selectable text; grayscale/flatten)
   → order late, surface the warning the redact tool already shows.
4. **Per-page DPI/coordinate scale** (multi-page) vs CloakIMG's single global scale →
   per-page converters, never one global scale.
5. **blob: thumbnail leaks** across sessions → centralize revoke in the context's
   doc-replace/unmount.
6. **Unmount destroys unsaved overlay state** until M3 autosave → land draft autosave before cutover.
7. **Mobile landscape >760px** flips out of the mobile sheet mid-session → gate on
   `min(innerW,innerH)` / coarse-pointer, not naive `innerWidth`.

## Open questions (decide during M0–M3)

- **Deep-linking / browser back:** the app has no router today. A canvas users expect to
  bookmark/refresh-into will surprise them. Decide in M3 whether to add hash/History sync.
- **Workflows:** the runner already funnels steps through `useToolOutput.deliver`. With the
  unified doc model it becomes the headless mirror of `applyTransform`. Keep the Workflows
  surface as-is initially; optionally register the whole editor as one interactive step later.
- **Reuse vs rewrite per tool:** default is to lift each tool's existing options JSX +
  `pdf-operations` writer into a Tool/Panel pair, not rewrite logic. Revisit per tool.
